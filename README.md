# NLP-Domain-Adaptation-Exploration

### Abstract:
Domain adaptation is widely acknowledged as a challenging endeavor in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly due to the scarcity of large datasets and the potential for a domainâ€™s distinct linguistic features to detrimentally impact model performance. Given the rapid advancements in NLP, new techniques are continually emerging, some of which have not undergone comprehensive testing. In our study, we conducted experiments using a small dataset to assess the effectiveness of three fine-tuning techniques in the task of sentiment analysis.

### Here are the following libraries needed to run the experiment:
- numpy
- pandas
- simpletransformers
- torch
- torcheval
- sklearn
- warnings
