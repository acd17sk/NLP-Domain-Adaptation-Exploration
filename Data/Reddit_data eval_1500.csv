177,177, have been reading these threads for over week now finally some discussion about satellites made join let assume they had some satellite pictures days back and realized this days back would they not able slow fast forward the remaining days over the next days and get date location now why that day they talk about pictures from day then day they talk about pictures from day and realize that earth big and satellite not taking pictures all spots all the time but seems like the satellites are taking just picture per day then during this one day the debris has moved 100 they and hunt for those pictures amongst their million pictures that takes day and would also think they should able relocate their satellites specific area and track the ocean better but that too seems missing missing something ,2

181,181,here good graphic which have way verifying not sure already been posted not haven seen before shows overlay australia radar coverage and the last ping derived arc location the plane the arc goes straight through the satellite system which think already knew before someone highly motivated and with inordinate amounts free time could and stick there the various search areas and debris sightings that would super cool australia refuses confirm deny whether the plane was detected well according the trustworthy media but think either their system was down malfunctioned and they don want anyone know they did detect the airspace and are using that direct the search areas and are keeping secret for who knows why and need the doppler effect only cause cool either way can imagine that they did detect but are refusing use the info release other investigative agencies they spending boatloads money searching for this plane too and doesn make sense for them continue spending what they know incorrect also the plane was detected why would they keep that secret not like their satellite capabilities are secret don think this case the plane flying under the radar think this radar goes pretty low would have wasted enormous amount fuel and the pings probably would have cut off lot sooner think there good chance the plane passed through this region and wasn detected for whatever reason jpg,2
