636,there are many flavours buddhism pure land ideas are not common all them however the important thing realize doesn really matter that the big difference compared the abrahamic religions buddhism not dogmatic the sense bunch things that must taken literally else you are non believer sinner whatever maybe pure land ideas work for you great maybe they don great what works for you works for you what doesn work useless you the historical buddha himself taught dramatically different styles suit his audience parables and metaphors are just that the point where they take you not literally believing them literally and physically true zen koans are good example this very purely distilled most are the form stories but not stories you are believe physically happened you are reading history book that entirely irrelevant what the story does you that the point you are wondering did this really happen does this place really exist you are missing that point also worth noting that most things are about psychological phenomenon not physical phenomenon personally find this makes buddhist cosmology much easier understand than considering competitor physical cosmology they not conflict they just about different cosmos ,2

1136, here copy the judgment 1427183283 pdf you can add this the post 123 page judgement reading now and will post there anything worth sharing first the final judgement 119\ conclusion may summarise what has been held above section 66a the information technology act 2000 struck down its entirety being violative article and not saved under article section 69a and the information technology procedure safeguards for blocking for access information public rules 2009 are constitutionally valid section valid subject section being read down mean that intermediary upon receiving actual knowledge from court order being notified the appropriate government its agency that unlawful acts relatable article are going committed then fails expeditiously remove disable access such material similarly the information technology intermediary guidelines” rules 2011 are valid subject rule sub rule being read down the same manner indicated the judgment section 118 the kerala police act struck down being violative article and not saved article summary reasons cited section 66a freedom speech and expression under our constitutional scheme stated earlier not open the state curtail freedom speech promote the general public interest reasonable restrictions quoting from another judgement the right freedom speech and expression includes the right disseminate information wide section the population possible the access which enables the right exercised also integral part the said right the wider range circulation information its greater impact cannot restrict the content the right nor can justify its denial public order all these counts clear that the section has proximate relationship public order whatsoever the example guest hotel annoying girls telling – this court has held that mere annoyance need not cause disturbance public order clear and present danger – tendency affect viewed either the standpoint the clear and present danger test the tendency create public disorder section 66a would not pass muster has element any tendency create public disorder which ought essential ingredient the offence which creates defamation section 66a does not concern itself with injury reputation something may grossly offensive and may annoy inconvenient somebody without all affecting his reputation clear therefore that the section not aimed defamatory statements all incitement offence section 66a has nothing with “incitement offence” section 66a severely curtails information that may sent the internet based whether grossly offensive annoying inconvenient etc and being unrelated any the eight subject matters under article must therefore fall foul article and not being saved under article declared unconstitutional decency morality what has been said with regard public order and incitement offence equally applies here section 66a cannot possibly said create offence which falls within the expression ‘decency’ ‘morality’ that what may grossly offensive annoying under the section need not obscene all – fact the word ‘obscene’ conspicuous its absence section 66a vagueness quite obviously prospective offender section 66a and the authorities who are enforce section 66a have absolutely manageable standard which book person for offence under section 66a chilling effect and overbreadth therefore hold that the section unconstitutional also the ground that takes within its sweep protected speech and speech that innocent nature and liable therefore used such way have chilling effect free speech and would therefore have struck down the ground overbreadth possibility act being abused not ground test its validity section 66a otherwise invalid cannot saved assurance from the learned additional solicitor general that will administered reasonable manner governments may come and governments may but section 66a goes forever assurance from the present government even carried out faithfully would not bind any successor government must therefore held that section 66a must judged its own merits without any reference how well may administered severability the present case where has been held above section 66a does not fall within any the subject matters contained article and the possibility its being applied for purposes outside those subject matters clear therefore hold that part section 66a severable and the provision whole must declared unconstitutional article challenge found invalid the petitioners were right this article argument would apply equally all other offences created the information technology act which are not the subject matter challenge these petitions find therefore that the challenge the ground article must fail procedural unreasonablenes having struck down section 66a substantive grounds need not decide the procedural unreasonableness aspect the section section 69a will noticed that section 69a unlike section 66a narrowly drawn provision with several safeguards first and foremost blocking can only resorted where the central government satisfied that necessary secondly such necessity relatable only some the subjects set out article thirdly reasons have recorded writing such blocking order that they may assailed writ petition under article 226 the constitution section being exemption provision closely related provisions which provide for offences including section 69a have seen how under section 69a blocking can take place only reasoned order after complying with several procedural safeguards including hearing the originator and intermediary have also seen how there are only two ways which blocking order can passed – one the designated officer after complying with the 2009 rules and the other the designated officer when has follow order passed competent court the knowledge spoken the said sub rule must only through the medium court order subject this the information technology intermediaries guidelines rules 2011 are valid ,0

1218,the bjp you claim more free market but don think opposition fdi retail they might have their reasons those reasons might justified but still not free market economics questioned modi tendency towards free market economics when his government banned gutkha not spitting and public littering but gutkha while leaving the ban alcohol intact not elegant enforcement penalties domestic violence public misbehavior but easy brute force ban alcohol the ban gutkha caused drop areca nut prices don know about gujarat specifically but speaking couple farmers karnataka where the congress govt banned gutkha understood there was drop about prices much for free market economics this concern regarding anti laissez faire was accentuated bjp leaning towards preserving culture the recent official declaration their homophobia was just example one would want question the sanity the thought processes the upper rungs the bjp the congress too hasn shied away from culture preserving stances example the statements made the mangalore mayor condemning resort culture following the attack group reveling teenagers resort you asked what the aap will differently from the congress the aap was among the first political parties come out against section 377 the ipc that criminalizes anal and oral sex the bjp was among the first support forthrightly and directly criticize homosexuality western disease the congress came out against section 377 but seems more like move salvage some support when elections are around the corner despite having been power since the 2009 statement issued the delhi high court the congress motives here are questionable they also going after the power generation companies delhi irregularities are found expect lot high ranking politicians will incriminated this one more item that the aap will differently from the congress the aap seems delivering election promises however vague words have been followed actions unlike the congress you might consider not delivering water unmetered customers bad thing but this certainly encourages all customers install metered connections further consider such policies socialist something against given voluntarist leanings but this still better than crony capitalism where land offered throw away prices corporates such practices are the beginning the rise monopolies monopolies are irreversible without socialist revolutionary intervention between the aap and the bjp still undecided whom would vote for but the bjp doesn have that great case against the aap you make out while the aap might have displayed socialist tendencies the modi government hasn exactly displayed laissez faire the bjp whole not sure about given their spectacular failure karnataka you might worship subramanian swamy but think nut job you might say nationalism but say self righteousness and the bjp and their conservative culture touting support base has lot would much rather spend government money subsidies than statue not that proponent the former ,2

1221,this the reasoning have mind regarding post godhra riots modi did indeed order the genocide and protect the perpetrators did not order the genocide but actively allowed happen and protected the perpetrators did not want happen tried stop but couldn however after the incidents defended the perpetrators did not want happen tried stop the best his ability but couldn actively pursued many convictions possible after the incidents and are brainers there should doubt anyone mind that such person should not become the also not positive because the fact remains that could not stop people from dying with whatever control had but indeed true would give him the benefit the doubt because his track record wrt development since the riots but the unapologetic tone disrespect towards the media aggressive rss support convince that very unlikely that true hence modi not the right person lead the country especially with many other able leaders found even within the bjp edit grammar,2
